## Technologies Used

## Getting Started

To run the Stock Control API, follow these steps:

1. Run a MySQL database container or have a MySQL server running.
2. Add the required database connection information to the `secrets.properties` file (see `secrets.properties.example` for an example).
3. Build and run the application using your preferred method (e.g., IDE, command line).
